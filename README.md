If you want to apply this texture pack, I recommend going to the <b>Releases</b> tab to download.
This is just so you don't download anything you don't need.

For every release, you have two options.

## No Geode
Download this if you don't plan on using any mods or simply if Geode isn't out yet! It doesn't include the modded main menu button textures or the texture pack info!

## Texture Loader
Download this if you use Geode! **DON'T** drop the files into the Resources folder, because you won't get the new geode button like that. Get the Texture Loader mod and put the pack **FOLDER** inside `[Geometry Dash Folder]/geode/config/geode.texture-loader/packs/`. Then you will see the pack in the Texture Loader menu that you can access from the main menu on the right. Just drag it by the "move" button on the right of the name and drop it on the right side! Press "Apply" and you should now see the changes!
